# tyr
A CLI tool to generate Node.js applications in an opinionated way. Tyr will get you from zero to a full-blown application with one command. Our CLI will generate a Node.js project, GitHub repository, continuous integration environment, container, and then deploy it to a cloud service in a matter of seconds. Our opinionated approach will save you time and headaches and will get you started developing code faster.
